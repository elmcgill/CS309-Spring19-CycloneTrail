Cyclone Trail is a reimagination of the classic game The Oregon Trail. Cyclone Trail is an Android application with a Spring Boot backend with a SQL database.

Cyclone Trail takes you, a freshman at ISU, on an adventure across campus to Troxel Hall for your first chemistry lecture. You must make choices at every turn that effect your finishing score when you make it to class.

Good luck on the trail.
